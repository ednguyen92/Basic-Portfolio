                            <p>   With my three years of progressive experience in customer service, in both retail and professional settings, 
                                  I have a strong desire to express my excellent problem solving, strong customer relations, management, and 
                                  administrative skills by pursuing a career that would lead to a challenging and successful position. My 
                                  personal experience with managing staff, building strong relationships, and efficiency in a fast-paced 
                                  environment will allow me to go above and beyond in my career path.
                                  <br><br>
                                  Currently my recent ventture I have expanded my skill set by becoming a full-stack Wed Developer. I 
                                  am excited and estatic about this new career path and have a keen interest in the field inside 
                                  and outside of the workforce. With the skillsets I have built through Coding Boot Camp at
                                  U.C. Berkeleys campus, I plan to build even further on that as a foundation for my future ventures.
